# SPIKE
This project is a professionally developed Nike-themed Spike Shoe Product Showcase Website designed to deliver a structured and interactive browsing experience. The website opens with a homepage, followed by a navigation bar that includes links to News and Featured, Men, Women, Kids, SNKRS, and a Find a Store option. A search feature is also incorporated to allow users to quickly access relevant information or products. The second section presents the three primary product categories—Men, Women, and Kids—each linked to its corresponding section for smooth navigation. These are followed by individual product showcases for each category, providing users with a clear view of the available collections. A dedicated Big Sale section highlights promotional offers and featured products, while the store locator section includes a map to assist users in identifying nearby store locations. The website concludes with a footer containing official social media links, offering additional channels for users to stay informed and engaged with the brand. The overall layout is designed using HTML and CSS, with attention to visual appeal, functionality, and ease of navigation.
